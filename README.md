# Molecules Properties Prediction

This project is dedicated to molecular property prediction using Machine Learning Models, such as Random Forest, Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Development Setup

The project uses Pipenv for dependency management. If you don't have Pipenv yet, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```
Set up the Environment

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/emanieluu/aml_project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd aml_project
```

Install dependencies with Pipenv:
```
pipenv install
```
### Model Training 

To train a model, run the following command:
```
python -m molprop_prediction.scripts.train
```
This command will execute the model training script. Follow the prompt instructions. Make sure you have the necessary data available and properly configured in the script.

### Hyperparameter Optimisation 

To train a model, run the following command:
```
python -m molprop_prediction.scripts.grid_search
```
